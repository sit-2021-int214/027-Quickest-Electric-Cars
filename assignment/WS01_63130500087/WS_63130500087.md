# Workshop 01 EDA: SAT Scores dataset

Dataset from [SAT_original.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv)

**Created by Name-Surname (ID: xxxxxxxxxx)**

### My Step
1. Define a question
2. Loading Library and dataset
3. xxxxxxx

## Define a question

1. How many observation of this dataset (before cleaning) ?
2. Are there duplicate data sets ? (If have duplicate data, list the data that duplicate)
3. How many distinct school in this dataset ? (Know after drop duplicate data)
4. What is min, max, average, quartile of each part in SAT ?
5. What is min, max, average, quartile of total score in SAT ?
6. Which school is get highest SAT score ?

Can add more question ....

## Step 0: Loading library and dataset

```
#Library
library(name)

#Dataset
sat_score <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv")

```

## Step1: Explore data in dataset (Diagnosis)
Code:
```
glimpse(sat_score)
```
Result:
```
$ DBN           <chr> "01M292", "01M448", "01M450", "01~
$ school_name   <chr> "HENRY STREET SCHOOL FOR INTERNAT~
$ math_score    <chr> "404", "423", "402", "401", "433"~
$ reading_score <chr> "355", "383", "377", "414", "390"~
$ writing_score <chr> "363", "366", "370", "359", "384"~
```

We found that this dataset contains 5 columns and these followings datatype
  1. DBN : character
  2. school_name : character
  3. math_score : character
  4. reading_score : character
  5. writing_score : character
  
  |Column Name|Datatype|
  |-----------|--------|
  |DBN|character|
  |school_name|character|
  |math_score|character|
  |reading_score|character|
  |writing_score|character|



## Step 2: Checking the types of values

For considering, datatype should be:

|Column Name|Datatype|
  |-----------|--------|
  |DBN|character|
  |school_name|character|
  |math_score|numeric|
  |reading_score|numeric|
  |writing_score|numeric|

So, start checking type

##### 1. DBN
```
#DBN checking
is.character(sat_score$DBN)
```
Result:
```
> is.character(sat_score$DBN)
[1] TRUE
```
Explain: 
- DBN is already character now

##### 2. school_name

```
#school_name checking
is.character(sat_score$school_name)
```
Result:
```
> is.character(sat_score$school_name)
[1] TRUE
```
Explain: 
- school_name is already chracter now

##### 3. math_score
```
#math_score
is.numeric(sat_score$math_score)
```
Result:
```
> is.numeric(sat_score$math_score)
[1] FALSE
```
Explain: 
- math_score isn't numeric.
- if you look at the data, you will see that some of math_score data are 's'. So it is count to be character

##### 4. reading_score
```
#reading_score
is.numeric(sat_score$reading_score)
```
Result:
```
is.numeric(sat_score$reading_score)
[1] FALSE
```
Explain: 
- reading_score isn't numeric.
- if you look at the data, you will see that some of reading_score data are 's'. So it is count to be character.

##### 5. writing_score
```
#writing_score
is.numeric(sat_score$writing_score)
```
Result:
```
> is.numeric(sat_score$writing_score)
[1] FALSE
```
Explain:
- writing_score isn't numeric.
- if you look at the data, you will see that some of writing_score data are 's'. So it is count to be character.


## Step 3: Changing the type of values


## Step 4: Handling string with stringr


## Step 5: Handling missing data and outlier


## Step 6: Removing duplicate data
