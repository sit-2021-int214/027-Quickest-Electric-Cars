2. Are there duplicate data sets ? (If have duplicate data, list the data that duplicate)
3. How many distinct school in this dataset ? (Know after drop duplicate data)

5. What is min, max, average, quartile of total score in SAT ?
6. Which school is get highest SAT score ?

Can add more question ....

## Step 0: Loading library and dataset

```
# Library
library(name)

# Dataset
sat_score <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/safesit23/INT214-Statistics/main/datasets/SAT_original.csv")

```

## Step1: Explore data in dataset (Diagnosis)

#Code here
...
glimpse(sat_score)
...

#Result
...
$ DBN           <chr> "01M292", "01M448", "01M450", "01~
$ school_name   <chr> "HENRY STREET SCHOOL FOR INTERNAT~
$ math_score    <chr> "404", "423", "402", "401", "433"~

$ writing_score <chr> "363", "366", "370", "359", "384"~
...

We found that this dataset contains 5 columns and these followings datatype
  1. DBN : character
  2. school_name : character
  3. math_score : character
  4. reading_score : character
  5. writing_score : character
